Welcome! I'm thrilled to introduce you to Fundamentals of Software Engineering. A project that's been a labor of love for 
my co-author Nate Schutta and me. Whether you're a seasoned developer, just starting your journey, or somewhere in 
between, we've built something special for you.

## The Book: Your Guide to Engineering Beyond Code

Our book, **Fundamentals of Software Engineering**, published by O'Reilly Media, is more than just another programming book. It's a comprehensive guide to becoming a well-rounded software engineer.

Here's the thing: there are countless books that teach you how to code in specific languages or frameworks. But software engineering is so much more than writing code. It's about:

- Understanding maintainability and why it matters more than clever code
- Making informed architectural decisions
- Writing tests that actually provide value
- Working effectively in teams
- Growing your career strategically
- Thinking like an engineer, not just a coder

We wrote this book because we wish someone had handed it to us early in our careers. It's the field guide we needed when we were figuring things out through trial and error.

## The Podcast: Conversations That Matter

Software engineering is an ever-evolving field, and static content can only take you so far. That's why we are launching the **FOSE Podcast**.

Each episode features:

- Deep dives into software engineering topics
- Practical advice you can apply immediately
- Real-world experiences from Nate and me
- Insights from our decades of combined experience
- Honest discussions about the challenges we all face

We're not just reading from a script—we're having the conversations we wish we'd heard when we were learning. The kind of knowledge that usually only gets shared over coffee or in the hallway at conferences.

## Why We're Doing This

You might wonder: why create all this content? Why not just write the book and move on?

The answer is simple: **we're passionate about helping developers grow**.

Both Nate and I have spent our careers not just writing software, but helping others become better engineers. Whether through teaching, speaking, creating content, or mentoring, we've seen firsthand how the right knowledge at the right time can transform someone's career.

Software engineering can be overwhelming. The technologies change constantly. The best practices evolve. The expectations grow. It's easy to feel like you're always playing catch-up.

We want to help you focus on what matters—the fundamentals that remain relevant regardless of which framework is trending this week.

## Let's Build Something Great Together

Software engineering is a challenging field, but it's also incredibly rewarding. The ability to build systems that solve real problems, impact millions of users, and push the boundaries of what's possible—that's what drew most of us to this field in the first place.

Our mission with Fundamentals of Software Engineering is to help you not just survive in this industry, but thrive. To give you the knowledge, skills, and confidence to build amazing things and grow a fulfilling career.

So welcome! We're excited to have you here. Let's learn, grow, and build the future together.
